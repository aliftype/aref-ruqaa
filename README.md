Aref Ruqaa
==========

![Sample](documentation/sample.png)
Aref Ruqaa is an Arabic typeface that aspires to capture the essence of
the classical [Ruqaa][1] calligraphic style.

The Arabic part of Aref Ruqaa is designed by the Arabic calligrapher and type
designer [Abdullah Aref][2], while the Latin part is based on [AMS Euler][3],
but spaced for regular text rather than mathematics.

Aref Ruqaa is a work in progress and is not yet ready for wider use.
